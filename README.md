# TestingRealDNA

This code use real DNA as Input, get all the genes and store it in a Storage Resource and then process it. <img align="center" src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53362962/88531367-5e6db380-d020-11ea-9a11-7c546f711047.PNG>

* Total number  of valid genes.
* The length of the longest valid gene.
* The numer of CTG codo  in the long strand of DNA.
* Print all the genes which are longer than 60 characters.
* Total number  of genes which are longer than 60 characters.
* CTG ratio of gene which are higher than 0.35 and print that genes.
